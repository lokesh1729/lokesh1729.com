# Domain Flipping

so it all started last year on july when my friend told me about this [website](https://domainz.io) called domainz.io. I went through the website, found it interesting. Did some research on buying and selling domains. At first I thought that i can make more money if i buy good domains. so, I headed over to twitter and asked `domainz` if i can make profits buying domains from him. he said buy some domains and sell it on flippa, so i bought subscription for 15$, then browsed through few domains and bought the following domains. Invested around 20k INR.
- cricketlive.tv
- filmed.me
- greb.me
- neither.me
- photogrid.xyz
- tiniurl.co
- wittycode.io
- internetspeedtests.org
- salesforces.co
- wimbledon.me
- kissing.tv
- rockstargames.io
- callrecord.io

I put all my domains in flippa.com with premium listing by paying 59$. I waited for 20 days but still no one has shown interest. I realized that I fell on a trap and domain flipping is not so easy way to make money. Then, I wanted to sell my domains at least for 50% loss. So, I went to namepros.com and put them on auction. Sold 2 domains for 90% loss ðŸ˜”. Also I got to know that we shouldn't buy trademarked domains like "rockstargames.io" "wimbledon.me" and "salesforces.co" due to copyright infrigments. So, I am afraid and immediately deleted those domains for loss.

Then, I heard about undeveloped.com (now, dan.com) and listed all my domains there. The good thing about them is they provide a neat landing page and statistics about each domain. I waited for an year, but unfortunately only one domain was sold.

### What did I learn ?
- never invest without knowing the basics of anything.
- don't over trust any website/person. in my case, i trusted domainz.io and ended up buying copyrighted domains.
- if you bought bunch of domains, try developing something on them. I tried but I couldn't.
- I can't recall right now, I will add them while I get to my mind
